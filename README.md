<h1>Google Search Clone</h1>
<hr><p>Fully responsive Google Search Clone made with ReactJS and CSS. <br/>
This is my first website clone. It allows the user to enter search term and gives it back results. It uses Google Custom Search Engine API that do not return results such as news, shopping etc thats why the option icons under the search bar do not work. <br/> The Google Custom Search Engine API has 100 request per day limit thats why I made a deafult request that is returned everytime there is an error. </h2>
